Chamber reactivity simulations were performed for alpha-pinene and limonene under photooxidation and dark ozonolysis conditions, 
followed by controlled reactivity simulations for alpha-pinene, camphene, and limonene.

The results include the time series of simulated SOA concentraion, SOA yield, and concentration of inorganic species, as well as properties of top species in the gas phase and particle phase of each simulation.
